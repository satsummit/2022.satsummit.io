Since 2012, Mabel has worked on numerous national and international research projects broadly focused on ecosystem ecology, sustainability, and conservation. These research projects ranged from a nutrient addition study on canopy epiphytes in La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, to an investigation of deer overpopulation issues in the town of Hamilton, New York. More recently, she focused on biocultural approaches to conservation in Ethiopia and Brazil. Through field work in Costa Rica, Ethiopia, and Brazil, Mabel has first-hand experience in how geospatial technology and data can be used by research scientists and in participatory action research with local stakeholders. Mabel is passionate about applied research and community-centered conservation that values cultural and biological diversity. Mabel has recently finished her PhD in Forest Resources and Conservation at the School of Forest, Fisheries, and Geomatics Sciences in the University of Florida. She was the recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and the McKnight Fellowship. Mabel obtained her bachelor’s degree at Colgate University in 2015, where she double majored in Biology and Environmental Studies.</p>"},"id":"ddcfacac-20bf-5785-b0b8-b5768d9f5dd7","title":"Mabel Baez-Schon, PhD","company":"University of Florida, Gainesville","role":"McKnight Fellow","twitter":null,"pronouns":null,"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQH/2wBDAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQH/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAkCBwoI/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQQG/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGp/mfR8xQFOrRkrhi7OY0B/VQDKv/EAB8QAAEEAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBAgMFBAcACBEWIf/aAAgBAQABBQLYZZ6WIatP7K2u08KnZ4ikgrxMxssAha5nO1rEixQPKkID5Pqf/8QAIREAAgECBgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDESEABBITMlEQMZH/2gAIAQMBAT8BifLJlpo5Ahnl0mJqpWLZLM6sTdd1SAoHK3VtY6Pw4ljjbMQu0aM68XKqWFACKMRUXJ9d+P/EACERAAMAAQQBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxEABBITIkFRUnHw/9oACAECAQE/AXjelp0QP1TOKeNPLsVApUBSrCbZLkkcBn610n5a2e53E9hu4TvZI049kUq6yfLBTzmGCtkAA5ByAB6awPYfsa//xAAnEAACAgECBQQDAQAAAAAAAAACAwEEBQARBhITIVEUIkGBFSNhkf/aAAgBAQAGPwLK8QDEG6hizmosu4MvukUUgON43D1DAk43jcILvGmcP5bInkitYBWfp2HtrMsCwbMIvqia1euEUnQ9VmikhKa4LYsDJcxA64d4eY8q9TKlYv2IGJmHfjSrihLOWJ9i+ub9vk+nO/t1iMqu+aMhjn46jjvT11VYfRm6pZY6z6ZShsquJkluJ0HLeb9hTMDrx3nt4/n1rg/Ir9lqtevVFlG3L0bFNbWiYzEwXMVdf1zRt31wLjshCpqs4iw5sBKlq5+m4XCJTETuPModx8TPzO+t/Pf/AHvr/8QAHBABAQEAAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhADFBEHGR/9oACAEBAAE/IdoJBCl64PL9L8fjvBLDrQfkCQx3i8IYeyoEpQuDZGIc8FRA+XK6QoYCFqL2XV6L67y9wQGtguUuaF0WP6kfmEmAYYAsF3p96P68/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABAEyIP/xAAeEQEAAgIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEAUWExkbHw8f/aAAgBAwEBPxAhkrhImJiJvag4ZWIJrRXPPnRjxKepuCIkEiFJa5Lt9+HbP//EAB0RAQABBAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERITFRYQBBkfD/2gAIAQIBAT8Qpg1BIk5VRAKFVEBPhY6tbf1ms80NYpOvWRIAZNmDOu33n//EABoQAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQeH/2gAIAQEAAT8QSzzPFqxb5P4MhKczfBpBSJJbpS7UWresYcSm7y3QBIRzXDzwlgHNrFrKa4kyYZIUjg+o44Cx83TjLYW8ZOxqu+U6wws2tNyo1bPq1R+7P//Z"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d623183f66af2c926e2314ecefec5404/1b50a/mabel-baezschon.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d623183f66af2c926e2314ecefec5404/c904d/mabel-baezschon.jpg 160w,\n/static/d623183f66af2c926e2314ecefec5404/b95ad/mabel-baezschon.jpg 320w,\n/static/d623183f66af2c926e2314ecefec5404/1b50a/mabel-baezschon.jpg 640w","sizes":"(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d623183f66af2c926e2314ecefec5404/c6aca/mabel-baezschon.webp 160w,\n/static/d623183f66af2c926e2314ecefec5404/0a0af/mabel-baezschon.webp 320w,\n/static/d623183f66af2c926e2314ecefec5404/8ae69/mabel-baezschon.webp 640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"}]},"width":640,"height":640}}},"events":[{"role":"speakers","event":{"parent":{"html":"<p>What does an environmentally just world look like?
