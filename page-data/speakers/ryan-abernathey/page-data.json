Abernathey, an Associate Professor of <a href=\"https://eesc.columbia.edu/\">Earth And Environmental Science at Columbia University</a> and <a href=\"https://lamont.columbia.edu/\">Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory</a>, is a physical oceanographer who studies large-scale ocean circulation and its relationship with Earth's climate. He received his Ph.D. from MIT in 2012 and did a postdoc at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He has received an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in Ocean Sciences, an NSF CAREER award, The Oceanography Society Early Career Award, and the AGU Falkenberg Award. He is a member of the NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) science team and Director of Data and Computing for a new NSF Science and Technology Center called Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP). Prof. Abernathey is an active participant in and advocate for open source software, open data, and reproducible science. In 2016 he helped found the Pangeo project, an open science community focused on big scientific data analytics.</p>"},"id":"f0e1eb9e-db3a-52e6-b3bb-f119c685215a","title":"Ryan Abernathey, PhD","company":"Columbia University and Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory","role":"Associate Professor and Physical Oceanographer","twitter":"rabernat","pronouns":null,"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/baa87c4179a4f50aaa34918a0e0f6a0b/1b50a/ryan-abernathey.jpg","srcSet":"/static/baa87c4179a4f50aaa34918a0e0f6a0b/c904d/ryan-abernathey.jpg 160w,\n/static/baa87c4179a4f50aaa34918a0e0f6a0b/b95ad/ryan-abernathey.jpg 320w,\n/static/baa87c4179a4f50aaa34918a0e0f6a0b/1b50a/ryan-abernathey.jpg 640w","sizes":"(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/baa87c4179a4f50aaa34918a0e0f6a0b/c6aca/ryan-abernathey.webp 160w,\n/static/baa87c4179a4f50aaa34918a0e0f6a0b/0a0af/ryan-abernathey.webp 320w,\n/static/baa87c4179a4f50aaa34918a0e0f6a0b/8ae69/ryan-abernathey.webp 640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"}]},"width":640,"height":640}}},"events":[{"role":"speakers","event":{"parent":{"html":"<p>NASA has designated 2023 as the Year of Open Science.
