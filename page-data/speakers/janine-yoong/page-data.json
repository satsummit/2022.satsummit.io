Most recently, she led the location-based Augmented Reality program at Snapchat, where she connected new AR technology and 3D maps to local communities and venues. Prior to Snapchat, Janine was the Chief Operating Officer at Mapillary, a street-level imagery platform acquired by Facebook in June 2020. At Mapillary, Janine worked with mapping and navigation platforms, government agencies, GIS providers, NGOs, and location-based apps to get the most out of street-level imagery. Before Mapillary, Janine worked on strategic partnerships at Google and Yahoo, then scaled two startups toward successful exits.</p>"},"id":"28048e19-0d34-53b3-88ff-2e5cd1076810","title":"Janine Yoong","company":"_","role":"Geospatial Professional","twitter":"janineyoong","pronouns":null,"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c3232668ad15cd55580d2872890e6251/1b50a/janine-yoong.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c3232668ad15cd55580d2872890e6251/c904d/janine-yoong.jpg 160w,\n/static/c3232668ad15cd55580d2872890e6251/b95ad/janine-yoong.jpg 320w,\n/static/c3232668ad15cd55580d2872890e6251/1b50a/janine-yoong.jpg 640w","sizes":"(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c3232668ad15cd55580d2872890e6251/c6aca/janine-yoong.webp 160w,\n/static/c3232668ad15cd55580d2872890e6251/0a0af/janine-yoong.webp 320w,\n/static/c3232668ad15cd55580d2872890e6251/8ae69/janine-yoong.webp 640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"}]},"width":640,"height":640}}},"events":[{"role":"speakers","event":{"parent":{"html":"<p>AI holds great promise for automating insights from massive earth data streams.
