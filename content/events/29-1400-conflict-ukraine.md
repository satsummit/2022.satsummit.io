Ukraine is the most documented crime scene in history and earth observation technologies are playing a critical role in documenting Russia's war crimes and other atrocities. This session offers a discussion between members of the Conflict Observatory program, a new initiative from the US Department of State to use open source geospatial tools and data to document Russia's war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.
