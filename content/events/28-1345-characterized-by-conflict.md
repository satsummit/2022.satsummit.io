We are entering an era characterized by great power conflict. Satellite imagery is shaping the face of this conflict. It is shaping the way that we monitor and deter conflict, protect civilians, prevent atrocity, support refugees and IDPs and manage supply chain disruptions. At the same time, global conflict promises to change the Space Industry which has recently enjoyed a high degree of international cooperation around our common climate threat. What do shifting patterns of international cooperation and wavering commitment to peace in space mean for our work?
