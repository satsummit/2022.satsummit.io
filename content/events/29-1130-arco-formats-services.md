This is an exciting moment for analyzing data at scale. We've seen commitments to host massive earth data archives on publicly accessible cloud infrastructure; investments in analysis ready data products; the evolution of new cloud-native data formats and tooling; and massive improvements in modeling, AI and other approaches to generating insights at speed and scale. This session will explore definitions and standards for Analysis Ready, Cloud Optimized data and what is required to produce and process this data.
