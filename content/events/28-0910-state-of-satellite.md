The Satellite Sector has evolved massively since SatSummit last convened in 2018. There are new players and exciting new capabilities. Massive earth data archives are transitioning to new modes of collection, processing, access, and distribution that rely heavily on commercial cloud. AI tools for analyzing data at scale are rapidly evolving. We will hear from individuals sitting at the center of these movements. They will brief on the current state of play and prospects for the future across the satellite sector, data, AI, and ethics.
