## About

David Williams has over 25 years of experience as an ecologist applying spatial tools to benefit conservation and ecological programs across two continents. He has led the [African Wildlife Foundation’s](https://www.awf.org/) Spatial Analysis Laboratory for over a decade to support conservation planning and monitoring under the aegis of AWF’s landscape conservation approach. David applies a range of spatial tools to assess wildlife populations, human livelihoods and land use impacts on ecosystems. His research interests include use of scenarios analyses to inform sustainable land use planning and the evaluation of conservation outcomes with a focus on law enforcement effectiveness. These interests drive a range of partner engagements involving use of emerging technologies with universities to decision-support collaborations with governments. David earned a master’s degree in ecology from Duke University and a bachelor’s degree in English literature from University of Michigan.
