## About

Michele obtained a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Biological Sciences with secondary teaching certification from Michigan State University and taught public school for several years after graduation. Michele earned a Master’s of Science in Ecology with a focus in Stream Ecology from Idaho State University. It is there that Michele began her interest in geospatial applications in the Earth Sciences. Michele worked for several years at the University of Montana in GIS/RS and also at the NCAR GIS Program before moving to the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/). At ORNL Michele was funded through the North American Carbon Program (NACP) to produce the North American standardized distribution and specialized access methods for the [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) dataset; now distributed through the [ORNL DAAC](https://daac.ornl.gov/); part of NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System. Michele is the project lead for the Daymet dataset and also the lead for the DAAC’s electronic Learning Resources. Michele has recently taken on the role as the DAAC’s Airborne Data Lead. At the ORNL DAAC, Michele has continuously provided domain knowledge, geospatial standardization, metadata, and documentation support for dataset curation and distribution.
