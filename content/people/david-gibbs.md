## About

David Gibbs is a Research Associate in [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/) (GFW) at the [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/) (WRI). Although he works on a variety of forest monitoring projects, his primary focus has been modeling how forests store, emit, and sequester carbon globally. He has created a global model of greenhouse gas emissions and sequestration by forests from 2001 to 2021 at 30-meter resolution, as well as globally mapped potential rates of carbon sequestration from natural forest regeneration. David has also contributed to the New York Declaration on Forests annual progress assessment—which tracks global progress in stopping deforestation—since 2018 and assisted cities with including forests and trees in their greenhouse gas inventories. Before joining WRI, David was a research fellow at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and an environmental scientist at Tetra Tech, Inc.
