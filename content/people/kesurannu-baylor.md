## About

My name is KesUranNu Baylor and I aspire to be a future aerospace engineer. Many life experiences led me to this choice, but I will tell you the main parts of that long tale. First, I knew that I wanted to be a scientist after reading and researching the life of George Washington Carver for a 2nd grade book report. Second, I became interested in astronomy after watching a Discovery episode on the expansion of the universe. During my elementary years, I frequently visited the Owens Science Center planetarium to represent my school for the county by competing and winning 1st Place prizes in the Final Frontier engineering competitions as well as competing in the Mathcounts Competitions.. All of these experiences broadened my enthusiasm for STEM as well as my curiosity of aerospace. In 5th grade, I participated in a Johns Hopkins Space Science summer camp and learned about space missions as well as how to create my own proposal;I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in aerospace from these experiences. However, the most awakening experience was learning physics my junior year. I discovered that I was good at kinematic and understood how an object can move without a constant acceleration. I was introduced to the rules of gravity and how little we understand it. Thinking about those kinds of theories excites my mind and makes me more dedicated to learning more.
