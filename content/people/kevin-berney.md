## About

Kevin Berney has been working with the United States Centers for Disease Control on satellite imagery projects and advocating for increased usage across the centers for the last two and a half years. Despite his degree in astronomy, he has worked in data science jobs associated with gene regulatory network evolution, international development, drug discovery, medical records, political microtargeting, and for the last fourteen years, improving processes and infrastructure for extracting data from satellite imagery. Though he currently resides in Atlanta, his home state of Texas has been beckoning since he left for college.
