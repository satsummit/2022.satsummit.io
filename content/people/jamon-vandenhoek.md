## About

Dr. Jamon Van Den Hoek is an Associate Professor of Geography in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University. Jamon leads the [Conflict Ecology lab](www.conflict-ecology.org) where he and his students use multi-sensor satellite imagery and large volume geospatial data to monitor urban conflict, forced displacement, and long-term environmental and climatic changes in fragile contexts around the world. He has recently written about limitations and opportunities of monitoring wars with multi-temporal satellite imagery, gauging the detection of refugee camps with satellite-based human settlement datasets, and measuring SDG progress in refugee settings with open geospatial data. Prior to joining Oregon State, Jamon was a Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and completed his PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he was a National Science Foundation IGERT Fellow.
