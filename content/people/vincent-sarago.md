## About

Vincent is a geospatial developer at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/). He builds open source tools, infrastructure and web interfaces that process and visualize geospatial data. The useable satellite interfaces he builds help break down the barrier to accessing and exploring Earth observation data.

Prior to joining the team, Vincent created the website RemotePixel.ca to develop web interface and cloud processes to access satellite data such as Landsat and Sentinel and distributes the data through simple and intuitive interfaces. Vincent previously worked as a geospatial developer at Mapbox.

Vincent is a graduate of the Nantes University of Science where he received a M.Sc in Earth Science. When he isnâ€™t playing with data, you can find Vincent out on the trails and streets of Bretagne riding his bike.
