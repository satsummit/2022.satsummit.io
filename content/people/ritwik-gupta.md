## About

Ritwik Gupta is a second year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley focused on AI for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response. His research on exploiting multi-modal satellite to understand building damage after disasters, shining a light on illegal fishing operations, and aiding first responders in evacuating in complex situations has been deployed worldwide by hundreds of agencies and governments such as CAL FIRE, the United Nations, the Red Cross, and more. Ritwik is also the founder of [Neural Tangent](https://neuraltangent.com/), a startup that aims to create AI/ML technologies that can operate in dynamic, chaotic, and compute-constrained environments to provide better decisions in situations that have minimal room for error.
