## About

Benjamin Thelonious Fels is the CEO and founder of [MACRO-EYES](https://www.macro-eyes.com/): venture-backed AI company creating self-improving supply chains, shifting crucial networks to respond precisely to what comes next, rather than what already occurred. 

The first major investment in AI by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was in MACRO-EYES; today the technology is at work for corporations and governments across 10+ countries - slashing waste and radically improving unit economics. The core product STRIATA delivers enhanced capability to forecast consumption, allocate resources and predict behavior, even in low data and high uncertainty environments. STRIATA has improved supply and demand forecasts by more than 20% in every deployment. 

MACRO-EYES is working towards a world where nothing is wasted and where each resource generates the greatest impact. Benjamin has particular expertise leading development and deployment of technology that learns to make predictions in complex, dynamic settings. Prior to Macro-Eyes, he was a derivatives trader and managed global teams that built and deployed trading systems that learned in real-time across financial markets. Benjamin advises the World Health Organization on the future of digital health and the Financial Times published his op-ed on AI. He has spoken on applied AI at the University of Washington, Northwestern University, the World Bank and at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Benjamin is a Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation Social Impact Entrepreneur. He is a graduate of Wesleyan University in Connecticut.
