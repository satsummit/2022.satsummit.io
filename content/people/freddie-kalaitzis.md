## About

Freddie is a Senior Research Fellow at the Dept. of Computer Science, University of Oxford, investigating topics mainly in AI for Earth Observation. He is the principal investigator of OpenSR, a â‚¬1M government contract with ESA, to increase the safety of Super-Resolution technology for the Sentinel-2 archive. He is also an independent consultant, involved in projects where he leads teams in the Frontier Development Lab (FDL), a private-public partnership between NASA, SETI, and Trillium Technologies. His recent FDL projects were funded by NASA SMD to investigate the use of SAR imagery for disaster detection, and by the USGS to develop near-real-time water stream mapping from daily PlanetScope imagery. His most recent work is a survey on the State of AI for Earth Observation, in collaboration with Satellite Applications Catapult.
