## About

Marie Urban leads the Human Geography Group within the Geospatial Science and Human Security Division to develop data-driven, statistical, computational methods for delivering informative baseline population distributions and human activity datasets from local to planet-scale. Marie was initially involved in mission support for the LandScan Program which continues at the core of research and development within the Human Geography Group today. As a group leader, her support has extended the success of the program to span nearly 25 years of successful annual deliveries of population distribution data to stakeholders and several critical DoD programs and distribution to thousands of academic and US Federal government users. In addition, Marie has led a multi-disciplinary team to develop and implement a global-scale probabilistic learning system that delivers national and subnational building occupancy estimates.
