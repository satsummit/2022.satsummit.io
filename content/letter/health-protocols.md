## Concerning Covid-19

We're excited to welcome you to SatSummit 2022 in-person, but realize the COVID-19 pandemic is still an important consideration for many of you. We ask if you attend SatSummit 2022 that you help us create the safest environment we can as we reacquaint ourselves with in-person meetings.

We want everyone to have a safe and enjoyable conference! We're monitoring national and local  (Washington DC) health and safety guidelines for COVID-19. The following recommendations are based on the current DC Health COVID-19 [Community Transmission Level of Medium](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/key-metrics)  (July data).

We **strongly encourage** the following:

-   **Get vaccinated against COVID-19**

    -   You're considered fully vaccinated two weeks after your second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, two weeks after a second dose of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, or two weeks after a single dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine *
    -   *Boosters are recommended for those in an eligible category as* [*outlined by the CDC*](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html?s_cid=11705:who%20is%20eligible%20for%20covid%20booster:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY22)*.*

-   **Test negative for COVID-19 before arriving at the conference.**

    -   We recommend a negative rapid antigen at-home test or PCR test.. There are two testing locations in proximity to our event venue, Convene:

    -   If you experience any COVID symptoms or test positive during or after attending SatSummit please follow our Code of Conduct guidance on Reporting an Incident by emailing info@satsummit.io.

-   **Wear a mask**

    -   We strongly encourage attendees to wear a mask(KN95, N95, or surgical masks) throughout the event. Face coverings should completely cover the nose and mouth, fit snugly against the sides of the face, and not have any gaps. For more information on acceptable face coverings, please view guidance on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html).
    -   There is limited ability to social distance effectively at [Convene](https://convene.com/locations/washington-dc/600-14th-street-nw/), especially during plenary sessions when we are all gathered together. 
    -   CDC recommends masking in public places if Community Level is High. If the Washington DC area moves to a High Community Level at the time of SatSummit we'll require and expect you to mask up unless eating or presenting. 
    -   We will have a limited supply of surgical masks available.


### Onsite at SatSummit

-   Provide hand washing stations with soap and water and hand sanitizer 
-   Provide hand washing instructions at handwashing stations 
-   Encourage and remind attendees about masking, social distancing, and what to do if you experience symptoms. 
-   Convene states that they provide 9.5 ACH  (Air Changes per Hour) and that they utilize above-standard MERV 15 air filters.

As the situation evolves, so will our approach to keeping you safe. We'll follow [CDC Guidance](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fyour-health%2Fcovid-by-county.html&data=05%7C01%7CCourtney.Goss%40dev.global%7Cf52afe982984444ec73508da70cb9625%7C84cf7db47b6243258968901994248aa9%7C1%7C0%7C637946316936569703%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=v%2Ftc9Lizg%2BBNe4Cmoiet9FW1oeuwZL8MwkwKobjAmKY%3D&reserved=0) for Washington, DC protocols that are in effect at the time, which can be followed closely on this website.
