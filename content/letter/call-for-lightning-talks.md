## Session Ideas

We want these two days of SatSummit to be useful, insightful, and thought-provoking. We also hope that people will leave energized with actionable tools, connections, and guidance. The planning committee is finalizing the Agenda, but we have space to incorporate other ideas from the community. That is where you come in. Have an idea for SatSummit? 

What do you think is important to the community? What talent, skill, or knowledge can you share? Below are some ideas, but we have flexibility in time and format to make the SatSummit of your dreams, into a reality.

- Training or Workshop
- Fireside Chat or Panel
- Working Group
- Demo
- Fishbowl or other thematic group discussions

### Criteria

We're looking for you to show demonstrations of useful applications of earth observation data applied to social and environmental problems. This could include new technological advances, models or science that are broadly interesting to the community. Show the art of the possible. 

These sessions are not intended as product or sales talks, but should be more in the spirit of sharing your experience with the community. 
Our [agenda from 2018 SatSummit](https://2018.satsummit.io/agenda) might be helpful as your shape your session idea.

Our planning committee will review all proposals and do our best to accommodate as many ideas as possible in the time we have available. We are interested in talks that provide diversity & variety of people and topics. We encourage women and folks from other underrepresented groups to submit session ideas. 

**Deadline**: September 2nd 12:00 ET.
